# Decentralized Specialized Medical Device Development

A blockchain-based system for secure, transparent, and decentralized medical device development using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This project implements a set of smart contracts that facilitate the development, testing, and regulatory approval of specialized medical devices. By leveraging blockchain technology, it provides transparency, immutability, and security throughout the medical device development lifecycle.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Inventor Verification Contract

The `inventor-verification.clar` contract validates the credentials of medical innovators:

- Registration of inventors with their credentials and specialization
- Admin-controlled verification process
- Immutable record of verification status and date
- Read-only functions to check verification status

### 2. Design Documentation Contract

The `design-documentation.clar` contract securely stores device specifications:

- Registration of device designs with detailed specifications
- Version control system that maintains the complete history of design changes
- Secure storage of documentation hashes for integrity verification
- Read-only functions to access current and historical design data

### 3. Testing Verification Contract

The `testing-verification.clar` contract records laboratory and clinical trial results:

- Registration of test records linked to specific device designs
- Verification mechanism for test results
- Secure storage of test result hashes
- Read-only functions to check test verification status

### 4. Regulatory Submission Contract

The `regulatory-submission.clar` contract tracks the approval process with regulatory authorities:

- Creation of regulatory submissions linked to designs and test results
- Status tracking throughout the approval process
- Storage of approval IDs and regulatory comments
- Read-only functions to check submission status

## Getting Started
